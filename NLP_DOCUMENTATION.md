# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Features

## Overview

The Learnora Content Discovery System now includes **TRUE Natural Language Processing** capabilities that enable it to understand and process conversational queries, extract meaning, and provide intelligent search results.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Query Expansion**
Automatically expands queries with synonyms and related terms for better search coverage.

```python
from Project import NaturalLanguageProcessor

nlp = NaturalLanguageProcessor()

# Simple query
query = "ML tutorial"

# Expanded query includes synonyms
expanded = nlp.expand_query(query)
# Result: "ML tutorial machine learning ml"
```

**Supported Expansions:**
- `ML` → `machine learning`, `ml`
- `AI` → `artificial intelligence`, `ai`
- `JS` → `javascript`, `js`, `node`
- `web dev` → `web development`, `web programming`
- `coding` → `programming`, `development`, `software development`
- And many more...

### 2. **Intent Detection**
Understands what the user wants to do with their query.

```python
nlp = NaturalLanguageProcessor()

result = nlp.extract_intent("I want to learn Python programming")

print(result)
# {
#     "primary": "learning",
#     "all_intents": {"learning": 2, "tutorial": 1},
#     "confidence": 0.5
# }
```

**Detected Intents:**
- **Learning**: "I want to learn...", "teach me...", "help me understand..."
- **Tutorial**: "show me a tutorial", "step by step guide..."
- **Reference**: "documentation", "API reference", "lookup..."
- **Project**: "how to build...", "create an app...", "develop..."

### 3. **Entity Extraction**
Extracts structured information from natural language queries.

```python
nlp = NaturalLanguageProcessor()

entities = nlp.extract_entities("beginner Python video tutorials")

print(entities)
# {
#     "topics": ["python", "tutorial"],
#     "difficulty": ["beginner"],
#     "formats": ["video"]
# }
```

**Extracted Entities:**
- **Topics**: Programming languages, technologies, subjects
- **Difficulty**: Beginner, intermediate, advanced
- **Formats**: Video, article, course, tutorial, book

### 4. **Stop Word Filtering**
Removes common words that don't add meaning to searches.

```python
nlp = NaturalLanguageProcessor()

key_terms = nlp.extract_key_terms("I want to learn about Python programming")

print(key_terms)
# ["want", "learn", "python", "programming"]
# Removed: "I", "to", "about"
```

### 5. **Comprehensive Query Processing**
All-in-one processing method that applies all NLP features.

```python
nlp = NaturalLanguageProcessor()

result = nlp.process_query("I'm new to programming and want to learn Python")

print(result)
# {
#     "original_query": "I'm new to programming and want to learn Python",
#     "expanded_query": "I'm new to programming and want to learn Python python py programming coding development learn study master",
#     "intent": {"primary": "learning", "all_intents": {...}, "confidence": 0.67},
#     "entities": {
#         "topics": ["python", "programming"],
#         "difficulty": ["beginner"],
#         "formats": []
#     },
#     "key_terms": ["new", "programming", "want", "learn", "python"]
# }
```

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic NLP Usage

```python
from Project import NaturalLanguageProcessor

# Initialize NLP processor
nlp = NaturalLanguageProcessor()

# Process a natural language query
query = "Can you help me learn JavaScript? I'm a beginner."
result = nlp.process_query(query)

print(f"Intent: {result['intent']['primary']}")
print(f"Topics: {result['entities']['topics']}")
print(f"Difficulty: {result['entities']['difficulty']}")
```

### Example 2: Integrated Search with NLP

```python
from Project import LearnoraContentDiscovery, UserProfile

# Initialize with NLP enabled (default)
discovery = LearnoraContentDiscovery(enable_nlp=True)

user = UserProfile(user_id="user123")

# Use natural language query
results = discovery.discover_and_personalize(
    query="I want to learn machine learning for beginners",
    user_profile=user,
    use_nlp=True,  # Enable NLP processing
)

# Access NLP analysis
if "nlp_analysis" in results:
    nlp_info = results["nlp_analysis"]
    print(f"Detected Intent: {nlp_info['intent']['primary']}")
    print(f"Topics: {nlp_info['entities']['topics']}")
    print(f"Difficulty: {nlp_info['entities']['difficulty']}")
```

### Example 3: Conversational Queries

```python
from Project import LearnoraContentDiscovery, UserProfile

discovery = LearnoraContentDiscovery(enable_nlp=True)
user = UserProfile(user_id="user456")

# All of these conversational queries work!
queries = [
    "How do I get started with Python?",
    "Show me some good web development tutorials",
    "I need to learn data science but I'm a beginner",
    "What's the best way to understand AI?",
    "Can you help me build a web app?",
]

for query in queries:
    results = discovery.discover_and_personalize(
        query=query,
        user_profile=user,
        use_nlp=True,
    )
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print(f"Results: {len(results['results'])}")
    print(f"Intent: {results['nlp_analysis']['intent']['primary']}")
```

### Example 4: Compare NLP vs Non-NLP Search

```python
from Project import LearnoraContentDiscovery, UserProfile

discovery = LearnoraContentDiscovery(enable_nlp=True)
user = UserProfile(user_id="compare_user")

query = "I'm a beginner wanting to learn ML"

# Without NLP
results_basic = discovery.discover_and_personalize(
    query=query,
    user_profile=user,
    use_nlp=False,
)
print(f"Basic query: {results_basic['processed_query']}")
# Output: "I'm a beginner wanting to learn ML"

# With NLP
results_nlp = discovery.discover_and_personalize(
    query=query,
    user_profile=user,
    use_nlp=True,
)
print(f"NLP query: {results_nlp['processed_query'][:100]}...")
# Output: "I'm a beginner wanting to learn ML machine learning ml beginner novice starter..."
```

    "user_id": "user123",
    "strategy": "hybrid",
    "results": [...],
    "stats": {...},
    "nlp_analysis": {
        "intent": {
            "primary": "learning",
            "all_intents": {"learning": 2},
            "confidence": 0.5
        },
        "entities": {
            "topics": ["python", "programming"],
            "difficulty": ["beginner"],
            "formats": []
        },
        "key_terms": ["want", "learn", "python", "beginners"]
    }
}
```

## 🎨 Benefits

### Before NLP:
```python
query = "I'm new and want to learn ML"
# Searches for: "I'm new and want to learn ML"
# Limited results - doesn't understand "ML" or "new"
```

### After NLP:
```python
query = "I'm new and want to learn ML"
# Understands: Learning intent, beginner level, ML topic
# Expands to: "machine learning ml beginner novice..."
# Better results - matches more relevant content
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### 1. Difficulty-Based Filtering

NLP automatically detects difficulty and boosts matching content:

```python
# Query: "beginner Python tutorial"
# System automatically:
# 1. Detects "beginner" difficulty
# 2. Boosts beginner content by 20%
# 3. Reduces non-beginner content by 10%
```

### 2. Dynamic Profile Updates

NLP can update user profiles based on query:

```python
# Query: "I want video tutorials on Python"
# System automatically:
# 1. Detects "video" format preference
# 2. Updates user profile if not set
# 3. Prioritizes video content
```

### 3. Multi-Entity Queries

Handles complex queries with multiple entities:

```python
query = "intermediate JavaScript video course for backend development"
# Extracts:
# - Topics: javascript, backend, web dev
# - Difficulty: intermediate
# - Format: video, course
```

## 🔍 Supported Query Types

The system understands various query formats:

### Questions
- "How do I learn Python?"
- "What's the best way to learn web development?"
- "Can you help me understand AI?"

### Statements
